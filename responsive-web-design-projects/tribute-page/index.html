                <p><a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irena_Sendler" target="_blank">Irena Sendlerowa</a>, born in 1910, in Warsaw, Poland, was raised by her parents to respect and love people regardless of their ethnicity or social status. She grew up in the town of Otwock, Poland. Her father, a physician, died from typhus that he contracted during an epidemic in 1917. He was the only doctor in his town of Otwock, near Warsaw who would treat the poor, mostly Jewish community of this tragic disease. As he was dying, he told 7-year-old Irena:</p>
							</div>
							<p class="quote quote1">
								<em>“If you see someone drowning you must try to rescue them, even if you cannot swim.”</em>
							</p>
							<div class="p2">
								<p>When World War II broke out, Irena Sendler was a 29-year-old social worker, employed by the Welfare Department of the Warsaw municipality. After the German occupation, the department continued to take care of the great number of poor and dispossessed people in the city. Irena Sendler took advantage of her job in order to help the Jews. She worked as a social services director in Warsaw. She would make false documents for Jews in the city and had already started gathering her famous rescue network. When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto">Warsaw Ghetto</a> was erected in 1940, Irena saw the danger ahead.</p>
								<p>Close to 400,000 people had been driven into the small area that had been allocated to the ghetto, and their situation soon deteriorated. The poor hygienic conditions in the crowded ghetto, the lack of food and medical supplies resulted in epidemics and high death rates. Irena Sendler, at great personal danger, devised means to get into the ghetto and help the dying Jews. She managed to obtain a permit from the municipality that enabled her to enter the ghetto to inspect the sanitary conditions. Once inside the ghetto, she established contact with activists of the Jewish welfare organization and began to help them. She helped smuggle Jews out of the ghetto to the Aryan side and helped set up hiding places for them.</p>

							<p class="p3">
								When the Council for Aid to Jews (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBegota">Żegota</a>) was established, Sendler became one of its main activists. The Council was created in fall 1942, after 280,000 Jews were deported from Warsaw to Treblinka. When it began to function towards the end of the year, most of the Jews of Warsaw had been killed. But it played a crucial role in the rescue of a large number who had survived the massive deportations. The organization took care of thousands of Jews who were trying to survive in hiding, seeking hiding places, and paying for the upkeep and medical care.
							</p>
							<div class="p4">
								<p>
									In September 1943, four months after the Warsaw ghetto was completely destroyed, Sendler was appointed director of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBegota">Żegota</a>’s Department for the Care of Jewish Children. Sendler, whose underground name was Jolanta, exploited her contacts with orphanages and institutes for abandoned children, to send Jewish children there. Many of the children were sent to the Rodzina Marii (Family of Mary) Orphanage in Warsaw, and to religious institutions run by nuns in nearby Chotomów, and in Turkowice, near Lublin. The exact number of children saved by Sendler and her partners is unknown. The number 2,500 is estimated by Irena and historians to be of this division. 
								</p>
								<p>About 800 children were taken from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto">Warsaw Ghetto</a>, many of which were orphans. Approximately the same number were in orphanages and convents, Irena and her network assisted in the hiding of these children. Also, while working with the underground organization, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBegota">Żegota</a>, Irena and her network would assist in the hiding of about 900 children and many adults in homes around the city.</p>

              <p class="p5">
                She and her network made lists of the children’s real names and put the lists in jars, then buried the jars in a garden, so that someday she could dig up the jars and find the children to tell them of their real identity.

                On 20 October 1943, Sendler was arrested. She managed to stash away incriminating evidence such as the coded addresses of children in the care of Zegota and large sums of money to pay to those who helped Jews. She was sentenced to death and sent to the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawiak">Pawiak prison</a>, but underground activists managed to bribe officials to release her. Her close encounter with death did not deter her from continuing her activity. After her release in February 1944, even though she knew that the authorities were keeping an eye on her, Sendler continued her underground activities. Because of the danger she had to go into hiding. The necessities of her clandestine life prevented her from attending her mother's funeral.
              </p>
              <p class="p7">
                She has been honored by international Jewish organizations - in 1965 she accorded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad_Vashem">Yad Vashem</a> organization in Jerusalem and in 1991 she was made an honorary citizen of Israel. Irena Sendler was awarded Poland's highest distinction, the Order of White Eagle, in Warsaw Nov. 10, 2003, and she was announced as the 2003 winner of the Jan Karski award for Valor and Courage. She has officially been designated a national hero in Poland and schools are named in her honor. Annual Irena Sendler days are celebrated throughout Europe and the United States.

								In 2007, she was nominated to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. At a special session in Poland's upper house of Parliament, President Lech Kaczynski announced the unanimous resolution to honor Irena Sendler for rescuing "the most defenseless victims of the Nazi ideology: the Jewish children." He referred to her as a "great heroine who can be justly named for the Nobel Peace Prize. She deserves great respect from our whole nation." 
							</p>
							<p class="p9">
								During the ceremony Elzbieta Ficowska, who was just six months old when she was saved by Irena Sendler, read out a letter on her behalf: “Every child saved with my help is the justification of my existence on this Earth, and not a title to glory,” Irena Sendler said in the letter, “Over a half-century has passed since the hell of the Holocaust, but its spectre still hangs over the world and doesn’t allow us to forget.” 
							</p>
							<p class="p10">
								Irena passed away on May 12, 2008, and was interred in Warsaw’s Powazki cemetery—a place reserved for the elite among Poland’s artists, writers, scholars and war heroes. Her legacy is carried on in many ways, including the <a href="http://www.irenasendler.org/about-the-project/">Life in Jar</a> play, which is presented around North America and the world.
